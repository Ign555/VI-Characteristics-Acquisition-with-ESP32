# VI Characteristics Acquisition with ESP32

## Information

This program is based on [Vorachack KONGPHET thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03903993) that describe how you can get the VI characteristics with an algorithm.  
In order to compile this code, you will have to use VSCode with PlatformIO.  

Please, if you use it, do not remove Vorachack KONGPHET credits or mine.  

## Use

The project have to be use with a specific schematic that you can adapt depending of what you want to do. However, you will have to edit the code in order to calculate accurately the VI curve's points. You can find the KiCAD project of the board that was used [here]().
For more details, you can read Vorachack KONGPHET thesis.
